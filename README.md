# Generative AI Clipart

These are experiments using generative AI to produce art.   

* Experiments with generative AI - this folder has images produced with generative AI that look OK.  They can be used for whatever in the case somebody finds them useful.        


* Visual Notes for Machine Learning - this folder has images produced with generative AI that illustrate various concepts on AI and machine learning.  We use them to make visual notes, for slide decks and for articles. They can be used for whatever in the case somebody finds them useful.     

* Named Folders - The folder name represents the content (a Wonder Woman folder has AI images of Wonder Woman, a Alan Turing folder has AI images of Alan Turing, etc.)  


* Zi - the digital artist Zi is contributing some of the digital art she creates to the Generative AI Clipart project.
